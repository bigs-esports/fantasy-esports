    <h2>Cloud9</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="c9-bio">
            What does Cloud 9 have in common with the Los Angeles Clippers? Both teams looked phenomenal during the regular
            season and choked in the playoffs. With an outstanding 17-1 regular season, Cloud 9 was thought to be a clear-cut favorite,
            with only one loss coming to them by TSM week 7. As a major fan-favorite it looked as though Cloud 9 had the synergy
            and the momentum to walk their way up the LCS ladder to, and possibly through, worlds.
            <br><br>
        
            This season marked the first time in seven years that Cloud9 will not go to worlds. This team looked elite going
            into the LCS summer playoffs, especially with 5 big names running the rift.
            <br><br>

            Letâ€™s take a dive into the noticeable stat differences between Cloud 9 and TSM during their final match for the
            third spot at Worlds. To begin, there was a 40k gold difference favoring TSM in 4 game. Just looking at the KDA throughout
            the series it was apperent that mid lane was not holding up, and their legendary top laner could not support the weight of his team.
            Costly mistakes early led to a lackluster outcome for such a dominant team.

                        Drafted in the third round by TSM and quickly cut one year later, Liqcorice went on to become Most Improved Player of the Year in 2017. Talk about a player who came back with a vengeance. Since 2017 Liqcorice has led this team as the captain, and the MVP of this team his impact on the game knows no bounds. 
                        With a legendary stat line season after season, he alwasy stood out as a prime leader and astounding top laner. Taken ealry in the 1st round of the draft back in 2012 as the 5th overall pick,
                        he had an impressive debut against FlyQuest by posting an impressive 11/1/16 KDA. That match and that very moment allowed him to plant himself as the future and the foundation
                        for what we know as Cloud9 today.
